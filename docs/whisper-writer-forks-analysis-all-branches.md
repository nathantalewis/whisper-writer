### xblabs/whisper-writer (0 stars, 0 forks)
- **Last updated**: 2025-02-23T17:02:53Z
- **Total commits ahead**: 2
- **Commits by branch**:
  - [main]  fix: remove arbitrary key evaluation in three-key activation\n\nPreviously, when using a three-key activation (e.g. ctrl+shift+space), any unmapped third key was erroneously defaulted to KeyCode.SPACE, causing the activation to trigger for any key pressed in combination with ctrl and shift. This fix prevents the default positive evaluation by returning None for unmapped keys and adds safeguards in the event handlers to ignore such events, thereby ensuring that only the intended key combination activates the feature.
  - [main] ──────────────────────────── fix: require complete modifier chord for activation
